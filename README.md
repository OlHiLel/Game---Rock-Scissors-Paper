# Game---Rock-Scissors-Paper
A simple and not very high quality version of the game rock, paper, scissors, which was created for the sake of experimentation and to recall skills in the Python language, there are many options for improving this game, maybe I will add something over time or update the old code to optimize it. I doubt anyone will come here, but good luck everyone
